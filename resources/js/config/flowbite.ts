 * Flowbite Vue Configuration
 * 
 * Flowbite components are imported directly - no plugin registration needed.
 * For Tailwind CSS v4, Flowbite should work out of the box.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * import { FwbButton, FwbCard } from 'flowbite-vue';
 * 
 * Configuration is handled via Tailwind CSS classes and component props.
